## Lab 2

### Objective

The purpose of this lab was to successfully implement two sensors: one would detect a 660Hz whistle blow, and the other would capture inputs from an IR sensor blinking at 7kHz; both are important components to completing the second milestone of the robot. When successfully integrated onto the robot, the robot would be able to detect the whistle blow to signify the beginning of its maze mapping, and utilize the IR sensor inputs to detect treasures.
