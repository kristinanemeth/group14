# Milestone 2

## Objective

One of the objectives of the milestone was to be able to detect and classify between different treasures (frequencies will be 7kHz, 12kHz, and 17kHz). In addition we had to implement wall detection to the robot.

## Treasure Detection
### Materials
- [Infrared Proximity Sensor Short Range - Sharp GP2Y0A41SK0F](http://www.sharp-world.com/products/device/lineup/data/pdf/datasheet/gp2y0a41sk_e.pdf)
- IR treasure
- Oscilliscope
- A line-following robot
- [TI LM358 Op-Amp](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm158-n.pdf) 
- Phototransistor
- Some wires

### Methods
We used the oscilliscope connected to the outputs of the treasure (which is shown in the image below) in order to set the frequency at 7kHz, 12kHz, and 17kHz. We do this to ensure that the values measured by the phototransistor circuit will be as accurate as possible.

This video (as shown in Lab 2) reiterates our IR systemâ€™s ability to detect and distinguish tones of 7 kHz, 12 kHz, and 17 kHz: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN9lzJqB21Q)

In this demonstartion, we show our detection for each frequency with a 3 LED setup. The program on the arduino detects the bins that contain the peak of the FFT. Then we output to a certain pin to light the correct LED. We also have an inverting Op-Amp inorder to get a more accurate bin read on the FFT.

Red LED = 7kHz

Blue LED = 12 kHz

Green LED = 17kHz

TODO: Add FFT with all three freq on graph

## Wall Detection

TODO: code? 

### Materials
- A line-following robot
- short distance IR sensor
- Breadboard
- Wires

### Process 
We had an option of either a short-ranged or long-ranged IR sensor to detect walls, although we went with the short-ranged IR sensor. (Did we ever test either of them? Or did we just slap on a random IR sensor...). In our code, we determined a threshold for which the IR sensor would detect a wall: if below the threshold, a wall had been detected and the robot would stop; if above, there was no wall and the robot would move until a wall was detected.

We don't have the code on github - can someone do that? In the meantime, I'll just write something

    void wall_detection(){
      if (analogRead(A5) < wall_threshold){
        leftservo.write(90);
        rightservo.write(90);
      }
      else{
        move();
      }
    }
