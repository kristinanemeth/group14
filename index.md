# Group 14
### Giacomo Di Liberto (gvd8), Kristina Nemeth (kan57), Russell Silva (rms438), Joan Song (ys449), and Michelle Feng (mf568) :)

Welcome to Group 14's webpage, where we will document the progress and development of our robot and lab assignments! We are still trying to come up with a creative team name -- if you have any suggestions, feel free to email any of us at {netid}@cornell.edu. All stylistic suggestions and objections can be made in person to the webmaster. 

In the meantime, enjoy your stay!

(Please note that this website is still under construction)
